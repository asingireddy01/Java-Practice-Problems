     <h1> Naan </h1>
     <hr>
     <p> Our favorite food is Naan. Naan is a leavened bread made from maida, and Indian white flour that is very delicate and powdery, simalar to pastry flour. It is eaten most often with curry, used instead of a spoon to sop up all of the sauce and to pick up vegetables and meat. It is often seasoned with garlic. Traditionally, Naan is baked in a tandoori oven. Powered by charcoal or a wood fire, Tandooris get way hotter than home ovens can. </p>

     <h2> Why Naan is so delicious </h2>
     <p> Credit goes to the person who prepeared this on account of his/her experience. From the health point of view, Naan is made of Maida which is not a healthy option. Try Naan with 50% Maida and 50% Atta at home. The texture is not be as soft as the Original Maida Made Naan. But your health meter will be in greener side. Naan is generally made of Maida, yeast. oil/butter sugar milk etc ... and of course the resting time, ... the fermentation adds to the softness of the dish and makes it yummy. </p>
